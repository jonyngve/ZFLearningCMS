Zend Framework starter application.

Code based on the source code from "Pro Zend Framework Techniques" from APress expanded with setup for PHPUnit.

Project is not finished, it is added to as I read and learn more.

Notes:

EGit for Eclipse install problems
I develop this application on a Windows 7 machine. When setting up the git plugin in Eclipse it made a "ssh" 
folder under my user's folder, where in fact it should have linked to / made a ".ssh" folder. I had already
used git bash to create my repo, so the information I needed was already under ".ssh", so I just copied the
content from ".ssh" to "ssh" and restarted Eclipse. Up until then I couldn't push content onto the github
server, but doing that fixed it.
